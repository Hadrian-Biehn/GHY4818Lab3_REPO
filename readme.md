### Brief Introduction and Major Functions: 
- This project is an interactive web map that displays the route of The Stone Mountain Walk-Up Trail and some useful point locations along that trail. Along with the map is text explaining the trail and links to learn more about the area. These links specifically open a new tab instead of replacing the current one. The point features on the map can be interacted with to display more information about them.
